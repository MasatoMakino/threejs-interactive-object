# LLM-Collaborative Pull Request Guidelines

This document provides comprehensive Pull Request title and message guidelines optimized for **reviewer load reduction** in LLM-collaborative development environments. These guidelines complement automated code analysis tools like CodeRabbit by focusing on human decision context and explicit scope boundaries.

## Document Purpose and Scope

This document serves as the **complete implementation guide** for Pull Request creation, covering:
- Detailed structure templates and examples
- Text styling compliance specific to PRs
- Integration strategies with automated tools (CodeRabbit, git hooks, GitHub Actions)
- Quality verification checklists and best practices

For cross-platform text styling principles that apply to all documentation types, see `@.claude/fragments/documentation/text-styling-guidelines.md`.

## Core Philosophy

### Primary Goal: Minimize Reviewer Cognitive Load

In LLM-collaborative development, code review becomes the primary bottleneck. Traditional PR descriptions that summarize code changes waste reviewer time since automated tools already provide detailed code analysis. Instead, focus on:

- **Explicit out-of-scope items** - What reviewers should NOT examine
- **Human decision context** - Information automation cannot infer  
- **Scope boundaries** - Clear limits of PR responsibility
- **Strategic review guidance** - Where human attention is most valuable

### Reviewer Load Reduction Theory

#### Cognitive Load Components
- Intrinsic Load: Understanding the actual changes
- Extraneous Load: Determining what to review vs. ignore
- Germane Load: Connecting changes to broader context

#### Optimization Strategy
- Reduce extraneous load through explicit out-of-scope documentation
- Minimize intrinsic load by providing clear change boundaries
- Support germane load with motivation and constraint context

## Pull Request Title Guidelines

### Format Structure
```
type(scope): motivation-focused description
```

### Title Components

#### Type Categories
- `feat`: New functionality or capability
- `fix`: Bug resolution or error correction
- `refactor`: Code restructuring without behavior change
- `docs`: Documentation additions or improvements
- `test`: Test coverage or testing infrastructure
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks, dependency updates

#### Scope Specification
- Component or system affected (e.g., `auth`, `api`, `ui`)
- Use existing codebase terminology
- Keep concise but specific

#### Motivation-Focused Description
- Lead with WHY rather than WHAT
- Avoid comparative expressions without clear targets
- Focus on problem solved or capability enabled

### Good Title Examples
```
feat(auth): enable multi-factor authentication for enhanced security
fix(api): resolve memory leak in connection pooling under high load
refactor(ui): extract reusable button components for design system consistency
docs(api): add JSDoc parameter documentation for external integrators
```

### Poor Title Examples
```
❌ feat: add better authentication (vague, comparative without target)
❌ fix: improve API performance (what specific problem?)
❌ refactor: clean up UI code (no motivation provided)
❌ docs: update documentation (too generic)
```

## Pull Request Message Structure

### Required Sections

#### 1. Summary (Quick Scan)
Single sentence describing the change and primary motivation.

#### 2. Motivation (Context Priority)

#### First Priority - Issue Reference
```markdown
## Motivation
Resolves #123 - Authentication system lacks multi-factor support for enterprise users
```

#### Fallback - Development Context
```markdown
## Motivation
Customer feedback indicated security concerns with single-factor authentication. Technical analysis revealed current system architecture supports MFA addition without breaking changes.
```

#### Information to Include
- Problem that required human judgment
- Business or technical constraints
- Alternative approaches considered and rejected
- Decision rationale not inferable by automated analysis

#### 3. Out of Scope (Critical for Load Reduction)

#### Purpose
Explicitly state what reviewers should NOT examine

#### Structure
```markdown
## Out of Scope
- Database schema changes - No migrations in this PR, existing auth tables sufficient
- Frontend login UI - Current forms support new flow, visual updates deferred to #124  
- Legacy authentication - Existing single-factor flow unchanged for backward compatibility
- Performance optimization - MFA implementation prioritizes security over speed
```

#### Benefits
- Reviewers can safely ignore listed components
- Prevents scope creep during review
- Reduces cognitive overhead
- Clarifies intentional decisions

#### 4. Scope (Precise Boundaries)

#### Target - What is Modified
```markdown
### Target
- Authentication middleware for MFA token validation
- User model extension for MFA preferences
- API endpoints: `/auth/mfa/setup`, `/auth/mfa/verify`
- Configuration system for MFA providers
```

#### Dependencies - Integration Points
```markdown
### Dependencies
- Existing session management (extended, not replaced)
- Current user database schema (new optional columns)
- Email service for token delivery (existing infrastructure)
```

#### Boundaries - Where Changes End
```markdown
### Boundaries
- Changes limited to authentication layer
- No modifications to authorization logic
- Frontend integration points defined but implementation separate
- Third-party MFA providers configured but not integrated
```

#### 5. Review Guidance (Optional but Helpful)

#### Human Attention Areas
```markdown
## Review Guidance
### Focus Areas
- Security token generation and validation logic
- Database migration safety and rollback procedures
- API contract compatibility with existing clients

```

### Template Structure

```markdown
## Summary
Brief one-sentence description of change and motivation.

## Motivation
[Issue reference with summary OR development context extraction]

## Out of Scope
- **Component X**: Specific reason why unchanged
- **Feature Y**: Justification for deferral
- **System Z**: Explanation of intentional non-modification

## Scope
### Target
- Specific changes made
- Components modified

### Dependencies  
- Integration points affected
- Existing systems extended

### Boundaries
- Clear limits of PR responsibility
- Where changes end

## Review Guidance (Optional)
### Focus Areas
- Areas requiring human judgment
- Security or business logic considerations

```

## Integration with CodeRabbit

### Complementary Responsibilities

#### Human Review Focus
- Business logic correctness
- Architecture decision appropriateness
- Security design review
- Integration strategy validation
- User experience implications

> [!NOTE]
> Code style, formatting, type safety, and import organization are automatically enforced by git hooks and GitHub Actions. These items do not require manual review.

### Strategic Notes Section

When CodeRabbit analysis might miss context:

```markdown
## CodeRabbit Notes
- **Performance tradeoff**: O(n²) algorithm intentional for dataset size <100 items
- **Security pattern**: Token validation duplicated for defense-in-depth strategy  
- **Architecture decision**: Monolithic approach chosen over microservices for deployment simplicity
```

## Motivation Documentation Strategies

### Issue-Based Documentation (Preferred)

#### When GitHub Issue Exists
```markdown
## Motivation
Resolves #123 - User authentication system needs multi-factor support

#### Key Requirements from Issue
- Enterprise customer security compliance
- Backward compatibility with existing flows
- Configurable MFA provider support
```

#### Benefits
- Leverages existing problem documentation
- Avoids duplication of requirements analysis
- Links review context to broader project goals
- Provides traceability for future reference

### Context Extraction (Fallback)

#### When No Issue Exists
Extract motivation from development conversations, focusing on:

#### Decision Points
- Technical approach selection rationale
- Constraint-based choices
- Performance vs. feature tradeoffs
- Architecture pattern adoption reasons

#### Example
```markdown
## Motivation
Development analysis revealed authentication bottleneck during peak usage. Profiling showed session validation consuming 40% CPU during login storms. Implemented caching layer with 5-minute TTL balances security refresh needs with performance requirements.

#### Technical Constraints
- Memory usage cannot exceed 100MB for cache
- Session security requires periodic re-validation
- Existing authentication flow must remain unchanged
```

## Text Styling Compliance

Pull Request documentation follows project-wide text styling standards for professional consistency and platform optimization.

> [!NOTE]
> Text styling compliance is verified through LLM context-based checking. Manual verification is not required during review.

### Emoji Usage in Pull Requests
Apply strict limitation policy aligned with text styling guidelines:

#### Permitted Usage (Critical Safety Only)
- ✅ **Good examples**: Secure implementations, recommended approaches
- ❌ **Bad examples**: Vulnerable implementations, practices to avoid
- ⚠️ **Conditional usage**: Requires caution, has risks, context-dependent

#### Prohibited in PR Documentation
- Decorative emojis (🎉, 🚀, 💡, etc.)
- Status indicators (📝, 📋, ✨, etc.)  
- Emotional expressions (😀, 👍, ❤️, etc.)

#### Text Alternatives for Routine Cases
```markdown
#### Implementation Status
- Completed: Authentication middleware
- In Progress: Database migration
- Not Implemented: Frontend integration

#### Security Examples  
**Recommended approach:** Use parameterized queries
**Avoid:** String concatenation for SQL
**Conditional:** Dynamic queries // Ensure input validation
```

### @ Symbol Safety
Prevent unintended GitHub user mentions through proper escaping:

#### Safe Usage Methods
```markdown
❌ Add @param documentation to functions
✅ Add `@param` documentation to functions

❌ Implement @Component decorator pattern  
✅ Implement Component decorator pattern
✅ Add JSDoc parameter tags to helper methods
```

### GitHub Alert Notation
Use GitHub alerts for structured review information:

```markdown
> [!IMPORTANT]
> Critical information requiring reviewer attention

> [!WARNING]
> Important warnings about potential issues

> [!NOTE]
> Reference information and supplementary details

> [!TIP]
> Performance hints and optimization suggestions
```

### Bold Expression Guidelines
Follow text styling minimization principles:

#### Permitted Usage
- Specific word emphasis within long sentences
- Text labels for information classification (Note:, Important:, etc.)

#### Use Proper Headings Instead
```markdown
❌ **Configuration Options**
✅ #### Configuration Options

❌ **Requirements:**
   - Node.js: Version 16+
✅ #### Requirements
   - Node.js: Version 16+
```

## Terminology Consistency

### Basic Principles
- Inherit terminology from existing codebase and project documentation
